Feel that Bern.

## Mission
TrumpScript is a language based upon the illustrious Donald Trump. As the undeniably best presidential candidate in the 2016 language, we found that the current field of programming languages does not include any that Trump's glorious golden combover would approve of.

Just like he is making America great again, we hope our efforts will make programming great again.

## Installation
App uses Parse - a Backend-as-a-Service. To use, download the file and replace the Parse keys with your own. Parse is free, but will be shutting down in Janruary 2017 (fyi).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmmolaye/sandr.git
```

## Usage
* Write a TrumpScript file following the syntax we've specified (good luck).
* Execute `TRUMP /path/to/trumpscript/file`
* Enjoy the wonderful world of TrumpScript!

## Features
Our language includes several convenient features, perfect for the Sanders supporter:
* Swiping does not work from 8am to 11pm in your respective time zone. 
* Every fifth swipe will randomly swipe left or right.
* Messages cannot not be as long as the previous message.
  *i.e., if you message "hey," the response cannot be longer than 3 characters. 
* Matches disapear after two days.
